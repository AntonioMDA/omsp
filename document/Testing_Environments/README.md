# [OMSP-TESTENV] Testing Environments
## Summary
On a large number of occasions considerable effort is devoted to developing a system in a secure manner, analyzing the code passively and actively, and performin security audits. However, the development company is not usually aware of security in the development environment itself. 

These vulnerabilities can affect both the tools and methodologies used in the DevOps environment, as well as in the network infrastructure of the development company, allowing an attacker to modify the code maliciously before implanting it in the system or, simply, stealing the intellectual property of the company taking advantage of the lower levels of security with respect to the production environment.
