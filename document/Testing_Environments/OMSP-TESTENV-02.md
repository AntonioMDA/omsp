# [OMSP-TESTENV-01] SSDLC
## Description
In this control, the pentester must evaluate the security of the source code that is being loaded into production within the vehicle, in order to identify vulnerabilities and possible malicious codes that may have been added in an unknown way by an attacker.

## How to Test
There are many possible software that can be included in a vehicle and many programming languages that can be used, such as Mobile applications for remote control, infotainment applications, codes for ECUs, etc. It is vital to check their safety before launching them into production, in order to avoid that they can put the users of the vehicles at risk due to bad coding, or because a potential attacker has manipulated them in a malicious way.

Methodologies such as [OWASP SAMM](https://github.com/OWASP/samm), and automatic source code analysis tools, will help the pentester assess the safety of these applications that are being used in vehicles, providing an internal point of view about their resilience.
