# [OMSP-TESTENV-01] Hardening review
## Description
In this control, the pentester must evaluate the security of the development environment in order to validate that a malicious actor could not take control of the system and take advantage of a vulnerability to attack the vehicle being designed.

## How to Test
The applications and services exposed to the Internet are one of the most critical assets of an organization, and therefore, of a project of these characteristics, due to its constant exposure to possible external attacks by hacktivist, cybercriminal groups and states.

Similarly, and not least, the security of the interior of the development environment must be taken into account. In this environment an insider, such as a disgruntled employee, or an attacker who has managed to penetrate the perimeter of the network, can put the entire organization at risk, altering, destroying or exfiltering vehicle patent data, source codes, test plans, etc. These problems are exacerbated by the increasingly common use of cloud services, where the need to collaborate with different providers blurs the boundaries of trust, hindering the correct implementation of security measures.

Methodologies such as [OWASP WSTG](https://github.com/OWASP/wstg), [OSSTMM](https://www.isecom.org/OSSTMM.3.pdf) or [MITRE ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/) will help the pentester to formalize a standardized and repeatable test itinerary with which to evaluate the internal and external security of the development environment.
