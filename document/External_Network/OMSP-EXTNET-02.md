Functionalities such as opening the vehicle remotely, turning on the air conditioning, managing the alarm, opening and closing windows or turning on the headlines for its identification in a parking lot, allow a user to have several features that improve highly the experience with the vehicle. 

However, these remote control posibilities implies a higher responsability on the part of the manufacturer when it is validated the needed requests from these applications. This must be done since they could be manipulated with malicious objectives to execute other actions, and even access to different functionalities not contemplated in the application itself.
