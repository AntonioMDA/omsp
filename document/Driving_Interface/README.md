# [OMSP-IFACE] Driving Interface
## Summary
Driver interfaces are one of the entry points to the logic system of the vehicle. Beacause of its design, these interfaces are needed for the vehicle control. However, bit by bit they are adquiring a greater complexity, going from electromechanical interfaces to being electronic elements with a logic that can be exploited by an attacker to carry out non-considered actions.
