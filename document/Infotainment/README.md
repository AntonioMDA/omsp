# [OMSP-INFO] Infotainment
## Summary
Entertainment systems are an increasingly valued asset in the purchase of a new car. Trains and other public transport include these systems to improve the user experience and make travel pleasanter.

All these systems are composed of diverse hardware and software components interconnected with different networks and systems of the vehicle. Therefore, they represent a potential entry point to the most critical parts of the system, as long as hardening techniques were not correctly implemented. Throughout the following controls, assets must be reviewed individually and together, thus being able to assess the risk to the rest of the system, if any.
