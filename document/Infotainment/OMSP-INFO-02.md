# [OMSP-INFO-02] Driving Information
## Description
During driving, the vehicle's screens provide the user with different forms of entertainment, as well as data on the route he is taking, if so. This information can go from the current speed, the speed limit (read in the traffic signals or through the GPS system) or even alerts about an impending collision or a flat tire. There are many cases considered in a vehicle, and depend largely on the manufacturer.

In this control, the resilience of the information must be proven through attempts to manipulate it, by using both the vehicle itself and external means, in order to verify that all possible risks have been contemplated.

## How to Test
In this control will apply those attacks based on the manipulation of the perception of the vehicle, for example, the projection of holograms pretending to be real people or the manipulation of traffic signals to force a emergency stop putting in risk the safety of the passengers.

**External devices manipulation**
* Any manipulation of external devices that could trigger an incorrect handling of driving information should be considered. For example:
    * Camera data manipulation to distortionate real world perception.
    * Tire data manipulation to cause a false positive flaw.
