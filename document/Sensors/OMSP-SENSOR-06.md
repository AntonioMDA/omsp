# [OMSP-SENSOR-06] Cabin Safety Sensors
## Description
To increase transport safety, different systems have been incorporated that try to ensure the driving conditions are adequate. For a long time, trains carry a system called "Dead Man's Switch" that stops the train if it is not activated by the driver from time to time, which would indicate that he has fallen asleep or has faded.

Since the appearance of cars with autonomous driving, it is common to find similar sensors on the steering wheel itself, stopping the vehicle if the driver separates his hands from it for too long. 

## How to Test
An attack against these systems will attempt to bypass these sensors in order not to stop the vehicle even if the driver is not present.
