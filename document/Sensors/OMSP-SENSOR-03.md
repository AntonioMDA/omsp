# [OMSP-SENSOR-03] Driving Cameras
## Description
Driving cameras allow vehicles to inform the driver in real time about the state of the road, speed signals, possible obstacles and other data that will facilitate decision-making during driving. Likewise, vehicles with autopilot capabilities, both partial and total, use these cameras as the basis of driving, with powerful image recognition algorithms.

## How to Test
Throughout this control, the pentester should try to alter the behavior of the car, sending information to the vehicle through images and actions that will be interpreted by its cameras and that could lead to a risk scenario.

The manipulation of traffic signs or road lines, the simulation of pedestrians using static figures or holograms, or the annulment of visibility by means of an adhesive tape, are examples of tests with which the pentester can validate the resilience of the camera system and their abilities to protect themselves against an unexpected action.
