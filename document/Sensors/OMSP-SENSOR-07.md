# [OMSP-SENSOR-07] Remote Detection Systems
## Description
Remote sensing systems (such as radar, sonar or LIDAR) are used in autonomous vehicles and trains to identify the existence of other vehicles or large elements in the surroundings.

In some technologies, this detection is not limited to the line of sight from the vehicle, as they are able to detect objects hidden from view behind other larger objects.

## How to Test
The manipulation of these systems could make the autonomous vehicle perform unexpected actions or, in the case of a train, perform emergency braking when detecting a fake object on the tracks.
