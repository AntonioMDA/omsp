# [OMSP-SENSOR] Sensors
## Summary
Any industrial system relies on the use of sensors to know the context in which it is operating. In the case of a vehicle (a car or a train), some of these sensors will be vital to know the state of it (such as temperature, oil level or speed).

There is another group of sensors that, without being necessary indispensable for the operation of the vehicle, are necessary to improve the security, facilitate the handling of the vehicle or prevent accidents (such as cameras or proximity sensors)
