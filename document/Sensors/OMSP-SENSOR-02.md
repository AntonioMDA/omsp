# [OMSP-SENSOR-02] Proximity Sensors
## Description
A proximity sensor is a device able to detect the presence of nearby objects without physical contact. They often emit a beam of electromagnetic radiation and look for changes in the return signal.

## How to Test
The main goal of this control is to simulate fake objects to send erroneous information and force an unexpected stop.
