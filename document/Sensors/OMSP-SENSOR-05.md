# [OMSP-SENSOR-05] External beacons
## Description
Within the philosophy of the connected car, movements begin to be observed towards the connection with beacons on the road on which they circulate. This technological paradigm will allow the vehicle to know in real time the state of the road, reacting properly according to the incidents that have occurred. These beacons could indicate to the car events such as accidents, bad asphalt conditions, traffic retention, etc.

In rail environments, this philosophy has been used for a long time. For example, in Europe there is the ERTMS system (European Rail Traffic Management System), which basically tells the train how to change its speed depending on the state of the track.

## How to Test
These systems could be attacked by impersonating the beacon (beacon spoofing), indicating the vehicle with erroneous information to modify its expected behavior. Even if the readed data is treated incorrectly, it could be an entry point for the injection of malicious code.
