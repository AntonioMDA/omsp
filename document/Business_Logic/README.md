# [OMSP-BUSLOGIC] Business Logic
## Summary
Business logic vulnerabilities analyze the problems of using the legitimate system of the car or train in a different way than it was designed for. These problems can result in greater risks than 0-day vulnerabilities, as they can take advantage of the normal operation of the system, going unnoticed. These tests generally cannot be analyzed automatically.
