# [OMSP-OPCLOSE-01] Physical Key
## Description
The traditional method of opening and closing doors has been through a lock. Similarly, one of the oldest "exploitation" systems is a pick, which can be used to open locks without having its corresponding key.

Today, keys and locks have become more complex in order to avoid being opened by lockpicking or other opening techniquesand they are used in different types of environments. Virtually any modern car allows access to it using a lock and is even used as a backup technique if the radiofrequency opening fails.
