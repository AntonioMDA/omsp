# [OMSP-CHARGE] Chargers
## Summary
A charging station is a place that provides energy to recharge the batteries of electric vehicles (BEV), also including plug-in hybrid vehicles (PHEV). 

There are different kinds of charging stations, from those that simply provide an electric plug, like *Schuko* or *Mennekes*, to those that synchronize with the vehicle, exchanging information about the charge and price, such as Tesla chargers, making use of different plugs and protocols. 

Today, there are several protocols, such as [Open Charge Point Protocol (OCPP)](https://www.openchargealliance.org/protocols/ocpp-20/) or [OpenEVSE](https://www.openevse.com/), depending on the vehicle model and the charging point. There are charger models that are only compatible with some specific cars, such as Tesla vehicles and Destination Chargers or Superchargers.
