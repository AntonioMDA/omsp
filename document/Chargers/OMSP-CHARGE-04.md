# [OMSP-CHARGE-04] Mobile Charging Apps
## Description
These applications allow to manage the charger points through protocols such as Bluetooth. An attack on this system could disable the charging service temporarily or permanently. Likewise, an insecure design could allow modifying kWh prices, simulating the arrival of another subscription vehicle or causing unexpected behavior.
