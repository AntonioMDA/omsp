# [OMSP-CONTROL] Control Core
## Summary
The vehicle's control core, located in its internal network, depends largely on the manufacturer and the type of automotive system.

Traditionally, this control is distributed in different specialized equipment, connected in a network. However, in some current cars this philosophy has changed towards the establishment of a single monolithic control device that manages all the decisions and automatic actions that the vehicle must take.
