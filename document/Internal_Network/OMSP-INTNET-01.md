# [OMSP-INTNET-01] Physical Access to Network
## Description
In general, network logical security ultimately relies on the physical security on which the different computers are located. In this way, switching devices (the most critical devices in a network), are physically protected inside a cabin. This physical security could vary between a simple door with lock to an armored gate with multiple authentication factors for its opening. 

In case of trains, this kind of security must be considered during the design of their internal structure. Specifically, network elements should be placed in racks inside locked cabins somewhere hidden within the train. 

As for cars, there are different entry points to the internal network of the vehicle. Some of them are located inside the cabin whilst others are located near the engine, being uniquely protected by the hood of the car. In this way, it will usually be possible to access the internal network of the car from the bottom of it.

## How to Test
This control is based on physical access to the internal network of the vehicle, either through network devices (such as switches) or by directly accessing through the CAN bus.
