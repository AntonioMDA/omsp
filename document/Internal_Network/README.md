# [OMSP-INTNET] Internal Network
## Summary
Reviewing the cybersecurity of the internal network of a vehicle is one of the biggest problems that a pentester will face, due to the great heterogeneity and the high dependence on the type of the vehicle and manufacturer. The vehicle can be controlled by TCP/IP networks (connected vehicles and some train models) over Raw Ethernet networks (some train models), over CAN bus networks (traditional cars), etc. Your expertise will be crucial to carry out the project successfully, taking into account the specific environment.

On the other hand, internal networks have different mechanisms to interconnect with other networks. Bluetooth or Wi-Fi are some examples of networks through which a potential attacker could try to gain access to the internal network of the vehicle.
